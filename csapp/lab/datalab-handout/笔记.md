Use the dlc compiler (./dlc) to automatically check your version of
bits.c for compliance with the coding guidelines:

       unix> ./dlc bits.c

dlc returns silently if there are no problems with your code.
Otherwise it prints messages that flag any problems.  Running dlc with
the -e switch:

    	unix> ./dlc -e bits.c 

***

To compile and run the btest program, type:

    unix> make btest
    unix> ./btest [optional cmd line args]

Examples:

  Test all functions for correctness and print out error messages:
  unix> ./btest

  Test all functions in a compact form with no error messages:
  unix> ./btest -g

  Test function foo for correctness:
  unix> ./btest -f foo

  Test function foo for correctness with specific arguments:
  unix> ./btest -f foo -1 27 -2 0xf

Btest does not check your code for compliance with the coding
guidelines.  Use dlc to do that.
